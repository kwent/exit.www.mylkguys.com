			<h2>Hi Mylk Fam,</h2>

      <p>Unfortunately, despite all the amazing and hard work the Mylk Guys team put into this dream of ours, we are sad to share that we officially have to shut down our company. While we set a new bar for access to amazing vegan products by shipping nationally, the thin product margins in food, combined with the high cost of logistics & shipping, proved to be financially unsustainable for our business.</p>

      <p>To all of our change-makers (customers and supporters): thank you for trusting Mylk Guys to bring you the most delicious and amazing food right to your doorstep and for standing with us in our effort to make plant-based food accessible to everyone.</p>

      <p>To all of our brand partners: thank you for the tireless work you put in to creating the most incredible plant-based food, promoting plant-based living, growing the movement, and sharing your incredible food on our platform.</p>

      <p>Even though Mylk Guys won't continue to exist in its current form, we are super excited about how far the vegan movement has come and the progress that is continuing to be made. To see how much we've grown and the amazing community we've built from when we first had the idea is still unbelievable. There is nothing we cherish more than being able to watch our community interact in the way we were able to for the past year or so. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts.</p>

      <p>We hope one day to have the privilege of working with and serving you all once again. Until then, keep being change-makers and inspiring those around you to live a more planet-based life. </p>

      <p>With love and gratitude</p>
      <p>Gaurav & the Mylk Guys Team</p>
